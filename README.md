# House_price_prediction
As part of my Virtual Machine Learning Internship, I successfully completed a project titled "House Price Prediction using Linear Regression."

The goal of this task was to build a simple and interactive web application using Flask that predicts house prices based on user inputs such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

The backend model was trained on the well-known Ames Housing Dataset, using key features that significantly influence residential property prices. The trained Linear Regression model was serialized using Joblib, and the entire application was developed using Python, Flask, and HTML/CSS.

The project includes a web-based interface developed with Flask that allows users to enter:

📐 Square Footage (GrLivArea)
🛏️ Number of Bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr)
🛁 Number of Full Bathrooms (FullBath)

🔍 Project Highlights
🔢 Model: Linear Regression (trained using Scikit-learn)
🧠 Features: GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath
📦 Serialization: Joblib
🌐 Frontend: HTML & CSS via Flask templates
🚀 Deployment-ready Flask app (interactive form + result page)
